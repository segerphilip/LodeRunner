Created levels which are just txt files that can be modified by the user. From there, the user can select which level they want to play and the game will load it. The exit always appears in the upper right corner. The general key used is as follows:
0	blank space
1	bricks
2 	ladder
3	rope
4 	gold
5 	player (only 1 allowed per map)
6 	enemy
